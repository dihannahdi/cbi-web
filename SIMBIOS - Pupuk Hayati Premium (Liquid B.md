7. Dosage and Application Instructions (Tahap Pemakaian)
Important Pre-Treatment (Bio-Activation)
Step 1: Mix the Bioactivator (usually included or specified) into the SIMBIOS liquid.
Step 2: Let it sit for 24 - 48 hours at room temperature before use. This activates the microbes for maximum potency.
A. Seed/Seedling Treatment (Perlakuan Bibit)
Method 1 (Soaking Seeds): Dose 15 ml per liter of water. Soak for 8-12 hours.
Method 2 (Seedlings/Polybag): Spray/water seedlings with 1-2 ml per liter of water every week.
B. Soil/Media Preparation (Pengolahan Lahan)
Dosage: 1 - 2 Liters per Hectare.
Concentration: 1 - 2 ml per liter of water.
Application: Spray evenly on the soil/planting media.
C. Maintenance (Setelah Tanam)
Dosage: 1 - 2 ml per liter of water.
Frequency: Spray every 1 - 2 weeks.
Recommended Volume (Field Test): 2 Liters/Ha per application.
D. Disease Control (Pengendalian Penyakit)
Prevention: 2 ml / liter water, apply every 1-2 weeks.
Treatment (Curative): 2 ml / liter water, apply 3 - 7 days consecutively.
General Notes:
Spray in the morning or late afternoon.
Do not apply before rain (to prevent washing off).
pH Optimization: For best results, ensure soil pH is 6.5 - 7.2 (Use Dolomite/Lime 2-4 weeks before planting if acidic).
