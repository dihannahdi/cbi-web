3. Product Description & Unique Selling Point
FLORA ONE is a biological fertilizer containing living microbes designed to fertilize agricultural soil. It is formulated to match soil and plant needs.

Efficiency: Can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers (NPK/Urea) and fungicides by up to 50%.
Safety: Safe for the environment, leaves no toxic residue, and improves soil health degraded by chemical use.
4. Microbial Composition (Technical Analysis)
The product contains a consortium of beneficial microbes. Below are the specific counts based on the legal decrees and lab analysis (Universitas Brawijaya).
Microbe Functions
Rhizobium sp.: Nitrogen fixer (specifically for legumes), stimulates root nodule formation.
Azospirillum sp.: Nitrogen fixer from the air (for all plants), produces phytohormones (Auxin, Gibberellin, Cytokinin) to boost growth.
Pseudomonas fluorescens: Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), acts as a biological bactericide and fungicide.
Tricoderma harzianum: "King of Fungi" - Strong biological fungicide to control fungal diseases and decompose organic matter.
Aspergillus niger: Solubilizes Phosphate (P) and Potassium (K) locked in the soil, also acts as a decomposer.
