3. Product Description & Mode of Action
BIOKILLER is a biological insecticide formulated with specific entomopathogenic fungi. It offers a safe alternative to chemical pesticides.
Why use Biological Insecticide?
Selective: Targets specific pests without harming beneficial insects (bees, predators, parasitoids).
Non-Toxic/Natural: Leaves no toxic residue on crops, soil, or water.
No Resistance: Unlike chemical insecticides, pests do not easily develop resistance to these biological agents.
Safe: Safe for humans and the environment.
Mode of Action (Cara Kerja):
Contact/Infection: The active microbes infect the insect's cuticle (skin).
Entry: They can also enter through the digestive tract or spiracles (breathing holes).
Proliferation: Once inside, the fungi multiply and consume the insect's internal nutrients.
Toxin Release: The fungi release toxins that eventually kill the insect.
Spread: Infected insects can spread the fungi to others.
4. Active Ingredients (Composition)
Based on Brochure and Field Test Reports (UNPAD 2022 & UNUD 2025):
Active Ingredient
Concentration
Role
Beauveria bassiana
$1.0 \times 10^6$ cfu/ml
Entomopathogenic fungus effective against various soft-bodied insects (beetles, planthoppers).
Metarhizium anisopliae
$1.0 \times 10^6$ cfu/ml
Entomopathogenic fungus effective against soil pests and sucking insects.

5. Target Pests (Manfaat)
Broad Spectrum Control:
Rice Pests: Brown Planthopper (Wereng Coklat), Green Leafhopper (Wereng Hijau), White-backed Planthopper (Wereng Punggung Putih), Rice Ear Bug (Walang Sangit).
Soil Pests: White Grubs (Uret/Embug), Mole Cricket (Anjing Tanah/Orong-orong).
General Pests: Stink Bugs (Kepik), Aphids (Kutu Daun), Armyworms (Ulat Grayak), Mealybugs (Kutu Putih).
Specific Tested Pests: Nilaparvata lugens (Wereng Coklat), Liriomyza chinensis (Leaf Miner/Pengorok Daun).
6. Scientific Efficacy Evidence (Field Tests)
Study A: Rice Brown Planthopper (Wereng Coklat) - 2025
Institution: Universitas Udayana (UNUD), Faculty of Agriculture.
Date: July 2025 (Report Date).
Location: Tabanan, Bali.
Objective: Efficacy and Resurgence test against Nilaparvata lugens.
Effective Dosage Found: 3.0 - 5.0 ml/Liter of water.
Key Findings:
Biokiller SL was effective in controlling Brown Planthopper populations.
It did not cause resurgence (a common issue with chemical pesticides where pest numbers bounce back higher).
Safe for natural enemies (predators) compared to chemical treatments.
Study B: Shallot Leaf Miner (Liriomyza chinensis) - 2022
Institution: Universitas Padjajaran (UNPAD), Dept of Pests & Plant Diseases.
Date: April 2022.
Location: Cirebon, West Java (Endemic area).
Results:
Biokiller SL was effective in reducing the intensity of Leaf Miner attacks.
Yield: Significantly increased Shallot yield.
Untreated Control: 6.8 tons/ha
Biokiller (3 ml/L): 8.64 tons/ha
Biokiller (5 ml/L): 9.04 tons/ha
Standard Chemical: 8.8 tons/ha
Conclusion: The treatment of 3-5 ml/L was comparable to standard synthetic insecticides but safer.
7. Dosage and Application Instructions
General Application (Rice, Vegetables, Fruits)
Preventive Dose: 1 - 3 ml per liter of water (approx. 2-5 caps per tank).
Interval: Every 1-2 weeks.
Curative Dose (Control): 3 - 5 ml per liter of water (approx. 5-8 caps per tank).
Interval: Every 3 days until pests are controlled.
Method: Spray onto leaves, stems, fruit, and directly on pests if visible.
Special Protocol: White Grubs (Uret/Embug)
Method 1 (Media/Manure Treatment):
Mix 1 Liter of BIOKILLER with 50-100 Liters of water.
Add 1 kg of Sugar/Molasses (Gula Pasir/Merah).
Mix into 1 ton of manure/compost.
Ferment for 1 week before using the manure as fertilizer.
Method 2 (Direct Soil Spray):
Spray directly onto the soil or plant roots.
Dosage: Mix with water (standard rates apply) and target the root zone.
8. Commercial Information

Price: Specific price not listed in the snippets provided, but likely competitive with similar biological agents in the catalog.
Important Usage Note:
Since this contains living fungi (Beauveria & Metarhizium), avoid mixing with chemical fungicides as this will kill the active ingredients. Apply in the late afternoon (sore hari) to avoid UV damage to the spores.
